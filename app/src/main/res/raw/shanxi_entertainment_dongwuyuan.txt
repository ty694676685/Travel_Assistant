Xi'an Qinling Wildlife Park was rebuilt as the former Xi'an Zoo. Its predecessor was Tongfa Zoo. It was built in 1954 and moved to the foot of Qinling Mountains in 2004. It became the Qinling Wildlife Park. Based on the good ecological environment at the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains, the zoo is located in the shallow mountain area at the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains. It is 28 kilometers away from the urban area of Xi'an. It is the first wildlife park in Northwest China with more than 300 species and more than 10,000 animals.            

Xi'an Qinling Wildlife Park is a comprehensive garden project which integrates wildlife protection, popular science education, tourism, leisure and vacation functions. Xi'an Qinling Wildlife Park is the first wildlife park in Northwest China.            
There are all kinds of animals here, including mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, and their huge animal populations and numbers are the largest in Northwest China.            

The Qinling Wildlife Park in Xi'an has the largest and most comprehensive bird language forest in China, the largest Panther base in China, and the largest area of herbivore vehicles in the park.
