Xi'an Bell Tower was built in Hongwu, Ming Dynasty, in 1384. It was originally located at Guangji Street, Xijie Street, confronting Drum Tower. In the past, there was a big bell hanging upstairs, which was used to alarm the time, so it was called "Bell Tower".            

After Nanjing was the capital of the Ming Dynasty, there was also a proposal to move the capital. The minister advocated moving the capital to Xi'an. Zhu Yuanzhang had some heartbeat. He sent Prince Zhu Biao to Xi'an for field investigation, selected the palace base site and drew a map of Shaanxi Province. After returning from Shaanxi to Nanjing, Prince Zhu Biao presented a map of Shaanxi to his father Zhu Yuanzhang, and introduced the geographical advantages of Xi'an in detail. He believed that "taking the world as Moguanzhong Ruoye, the world's mountains and rivers are only dangerous and the name of Qin is solid", and proposed to move the capital to Xi'an. But soon Prince Zhu Biaoying died young. At this time, Zhu Yuanzhang was old. The old man who lost his son in his old age was so distracted that he could not move his capital. However, the Bell Tower in Xi'an was built according to the royal building level. After the completion of the Bell Tower in 1988, it experienced a whole relocation. This eastward migration is related to the eastward expansion of Xi'an's urban development. On the west wall of the second floor of the Bell Tower, there is a monument of "Song of Eastward Migration of the Bell Tower", which describes the whole migration process of this huge building.            

When the bell tower was first built, it was situated at the Yingquan of Guangji Street, north of West Street, opposite the north and South City gates, and it was the center of the city. This position is on the central axis of Chang'an City in Tang Dynasty and the center of Chang'an City in the Five Dynasties, Song Dynasty and Yuan Dynasty.
