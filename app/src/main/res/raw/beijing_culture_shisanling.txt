The Ming Tombs are a group of tombs that buried 13 emperors after the Ming Dynasty moved its capital to Beijing. Located in the south wing of Jundu Mountain in Changping District. On the east, north and west sides of the Tombs, there are three peaks, namely, Shoushan, Dayushan, Wufeng Mountain and Cuihua Mountain, which stand like a tent, surrounded by a small basin of about 40 square kilometers, and thirteen mausoleums scattered among them.            

Surrounded by green hills and lush vegetation on the north side of Beijing, Mr. Kanyu has been praised as a place of geomantic treasures and dragon veins, so thirteen Imperial Mausoleums of the Ming Dynasty were scattered here, with magnificent and spectacular Shinto archways and underground palaces. The Changling, Zhaoling and Dingling Tombs of the Thirteen Mausoleums have been opened to the public, and many visitors have come to visit them.
