Bittern flapjack is a traditional Beijing snack, which originated in Nanheng Street in the south of Beijing. It is said that during the Guangxu period, because the pork made from pork cooked with pork was expensive, people used pig head meat and pig water instead of cooking. After the spread of folk cooking masters, bittern flapjack was created over time. Pork sausage and lung are cooked together with fried tofu slices, marinated sauce, garlic juice, soybean curd juice, coriander and other accessories to make the fire thorough but not sticky, rotten meat is not bad, which is very popular among people.
