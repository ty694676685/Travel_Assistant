"Historic Records" Yun: Lishan "is not as steep as Taihua, Mian is not as good as Zhongnan, as strange as Taibai, and as dangerous as Longmen. However, the three emperors passed down as old residences. Since Washeng's birth, since Zhou, Qin, Han and Tang Dynasties, many people have been lucky to leave the palace hall and embroidered Ling Wentang have become a good place."            

Lishan is beautiful as embroidery, also known as embroidery ridge. It is divided into East embroidery ridge and West embroidery ridge by the boundary of Shiweng Valley. Lishan was once a place where emperors traveled happily. There were many monuments and myths and legends under the mountains. "Weishui is white in autumn and Lishan is red in the evening."
