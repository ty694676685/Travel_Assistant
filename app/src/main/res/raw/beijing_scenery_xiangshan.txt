Fragrance Hill is one of the most famous imperial gardens in Chinese history. It is located in Xishan, Beijing. The mountains on the West and North block the cold wind and are very suitable for plant growth. At first, the emperors of the Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties built various pavilions, pavilions and parting gardens here. Afterwards, Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty made great efforts to build civil engineering and water pavilions. In Xianfeng Decade and Guangxu Decade, the scenic spots of Xiangshan were destroyed successively by the Anglo-French Allied Forces and the Eight-Power Allied Forces. After liberation, it was repaired several times before it appeared today. The famous scenic spots on the mountain include Zhaomiao, Shuangqing Villa, Ghost Seeking Sorrow, Jingcui Lake, Honeycomb Pavilion, Xishan Qingxue, Senyudi, Chaoyang Cave, etc.            
There are different scenic spots in the four seasons of Fragrance Hill, among which the most famous one is the red leaves of Xiangshan. In the golden autumn, the Fragrant Hills are covered with red leaves and the forests are dyed with beauty.
