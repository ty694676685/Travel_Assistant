Hukou Waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world. The Yellow River runs to this point, with steep stone cliffs on both sides and narrow estuaries, so it is called Hukou Waterfall. The Yellow River in the upper reaches of the waterfall is 300 metres wide and is compressed to 20-30 metres in less than 500 metres. The 1000 cubic meters per second of river water poured down from the cliffs over 20 meters high, forming the atmosphere of "a pot harvesting thousands of miles of the Yellow River".
