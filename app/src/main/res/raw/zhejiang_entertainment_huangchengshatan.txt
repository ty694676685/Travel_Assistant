Songhuangcheng Beach is located at the north end of Shipu Town, a famous fishing port in the southeastern coast of China and a historic and cultural town in Zhejiang Province. Every year, the main venue of the fishing festival in Xiangshan, China, is 1800 meters long. The beach is as flat as paper. It extends slowly to the sea at a slope less than 15 degrees. The sand is delicate and soft as silk. It is completely comparable to the "Qianbu Sand" of Putuo Mountain and the coast of Qingdao.            
The beach is backed by mountains, overlooking the sea from a very far distance. The sea and sky meet each other, and the white sails are dotted in the distance. The turbulent waves are higher than the waves, which makes people open-minded. Cliffs, steep cliffs and odd rocks on the northern half of the mountain are good places to enjoy the magnificent landscape of the reefs. There are also beautiful Nantian Island, Hualan Island, Dafotou Mountain and the famous Zhangcangshui Anti-Qing Barracks.
