14 km away from Dazu County ,stone caring on Mount Baoding were created from 1179 to 1249 ,or,In the reigns of Emperor Chunxi to Emperor Chunyou in the South Song Dynasty.The person in charge was Zhao Zhifeng,who was born in Xueliang township of Dazu County,several km away from mount Baoding.He became a monk when he was five, and moved to the western part of Sichuan Province to learn Buddhism when he was 16.Then he returned home and had the Buddhism "Daochang" built under his care.(Buddhism "Daochang" refers to the place where the Buddhist doctrine is publicized with images.
He dedicated his following 70 years to this course until he passed away at eh age of 90,when the forest of statues was completed at a preliminary level.The Buddha Bay we are seeing now is the major part of the stone carvings on mount Baoding.This Buddhism "Daochang" also includes 12 other places and extends 2.5 km.The total number of the statues is over 10,000 and some of them are titanic and imposing with various dimensions.Since the planning was unified and the craftsmanship was consummate,there are few similarities between the statues.Moreover,the statues are each in connection with each other and are each in accordance with the Buddhism doctrine.Almost the entire creed of this religion is included in one generation and thus a Buddhism Daochang with a comprehensive ,rigid creed and special features was formed. This is the only Buddhism Daochang that houses huge stone carving in China.
