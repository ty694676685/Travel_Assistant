Soybean juice is a unique food in Beijing. It is made by grinding mung beans with water to make vermicelli or doughnuts. After taking out starch, it is left with pale green and green soup, which is boiled after fermentation. It is said that soybean juice was introduced to the royal family as early as the Qianlong period. "There is a saying in old Beijing that people who do not drink soybean juice are not authentic Beijingers." Because of the unique smell and taste of soybean juice, it is difficult to get used to it without long-term contact.            
Drinking soybean juice is exquisite, first of all, hot, occasionally muttering a few bubbles of the best heat, and then must be accompanied by sliced mustard pimples, dripped with spicy oil, but also put on two "coke circles", eat the main sour, sweet aftertaste, mustard salty, red oil spicy, five flavors, plus the crispness and fragrance of coke circles, perfect match.
