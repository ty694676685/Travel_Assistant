Wave Valley is located in Yanjiazhai Township, 22 kilometers southeast of Jingbian County, commonly known as Yanzhaizi. From Jingbian County, it takes half an hour to reach Longzhou.            

When we came to the wave valley, we saw that the red stones were like debris flows, flowing in a circle, a tug and a bend towards the gully. This kind of stone is similar to a kind of sandstone, and weathering separation is very serious. Walking on it, if you don't pay attention, you will be slipped by the red sand attached to the skin. The red stones along the edge of the ditch go down. In the wide area, you can see the large and flat stone walls. They are red from top to bottom, and the color is basically the same. In the narrow area, the red stone presents a flowing water, like the red mud, flowing to the bottom of the ditch. At the Changzui side opposite Yanzhaizigou, the terrain is relatively flat. The stacked stones are like a large number of red cloth which have been dipped and dried on the ground. Under the rendering of the setting sun, they are unusually bright red layer by layer, roll by roll, and roll by roll; and they are like a stream of red water rising from the Loess flowing slowly to the low depression. Walking along the traces of the red stones, a canyon-like River crosses in front of us. All the red stones are solidified here in the form of flowing water, like a red ice hanging, and like a strand of frozen magma, and a small river flowing at the bottom of the ditch and a windmill rotating at the top of a mountain covered with green vegetation in the distance constitute a beautiful scene.
