It was built in Liao Dynasty and is the earliest Imperial Palace in the world. The layout of the Beihai Island is dominated by Qionghua Island. At the top of the island, a landmark building, the White Pagoda of Yongan Temple, echoes the Tuancheng on the south bank and the palace complex on the North bank, borrows scenery from each other, forming the north-south axis of the garden.   

The Beihai Garden covers an area of about 70 hectares, of which water accounts for more than half of the area. There are three islands in Taichi, Qionghua, Tuancheng and Xiushantai, which symbolize Penglai, Yingzhou and Abbot respectively, and reflect the pursuit of Penglai's fairyland. It is a pure artificial garden with water as the main body and islands in Taiyechi Lake connected by bridges and shores.     

Taiyechi's pool water originally came directly from Yuquanshan through Jinshuihe River, and from Jishuitan in Ming Dynasty. There are three islands in the pool, Qionghua, Tuancheng and Xiushantai, which symbolize Penglai, Yingzhou and Abbot respectively, and reflect the pursuit of Penglai's artistic conception. Its architectural style is influenced by some gardens in the south of the Yangtze River, but in general, it still maintains the characteristics of the northern gardens with dignity and dignity.
