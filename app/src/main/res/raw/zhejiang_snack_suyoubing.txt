Speaking of Zhejiang cuisine, how can there be no Wushan butter cake? It is called "the first point of Wushan". It is golden in color and looks like Jinshan. With a little white sugar, it is very sweet, delicious, oily and not greasy. It is loved by local children. After being tasted by foreigners, it is also praised.
