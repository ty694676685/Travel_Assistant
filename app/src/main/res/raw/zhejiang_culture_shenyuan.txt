Shenyuan was a famous garden in Shaoxing in the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It is said that Shenyuan in the past was several times larger than it is now. It was built by a gentleman named Shen, so it was named Shenyuan. Because of its beautiful surroundings, there are terraces, pavilions, rockery ponds, and so on, Chinese literati and ink-writers of all dynasties often come here to visit and write poems and paintings. Another reason for Shen Yuan's fame is related to a tragedy by Lu You, a great poet of the Song Dynasty (1125-1209). Huluchi, Songjing and Tuqiu in the garden are relics of the Song Dynasty. The two classical Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) buildings in the northeastern corner of the garden have been restored according to their original appearance, and a memorial hall for Lu You has been opened. At the same time, Shen Yuan built a "relic wall of Shen Yuan" with the excavated bricks of the Song Dynasty and erected a monument beside it. Lu You's "Haitoufeng" written by Mr. Xia Chengtao, a famous expert in the study of Song Ci in China, was inscribed on the monument. On the back was a poem written by Lu You and Tang Wan after they met 40 years ago.
